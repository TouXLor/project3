        <h2>Intersectionality</h1>
      
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.womankind.org.uk/intersectionality-101-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-important/">Intersectionality</a> is a framework for understanding how various aspects of a person’s identity—such as race, gender, class, sexuality, ability, and more—intersect and interact to create unique experiences of privilege and oppression. It recognizes that individuals face overlapping social inequalities that cannot be fully understood in isolation. Intersectionality serves as a tool to analyze structural inequality and injustice by emphasizing that social phenomena and human experiences are shaped not by a single factor but through the dynamic interplay of multiple factors. It suggests that focusing solely on one axis of identity fails to capture the complexity of social situations and power relations. Instead, intersectionality reveals how these intersecting identities work together to shape individuals' positions and experiences in society.

      <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589697/#:~:text=Implicit%20bias%20includes%20the%20subconscious,%2C%20affect%20their%20decision%2Dmaking.">Implicit Bias</a>, also referred to as implicit prejudice or implicit attitude, is an unconscious negative attitude toward a specific social group. These biases are believed to develop through experiences and learned associations between certain characteristics and social categories, such as race or gender. Even if individuals are unaware of their biases, these implicit attitudes can still influence their perceptions and behavior. Implicit bias is part of implicit social cognition, where perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes can function without conscious intention or acknowledgment.</p>

      <h2>Implicit Bias Test</h2>
    <p>The Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report. The IAT may be especially interesting if it shows that you have an implicit attitude that you did not know about.</p>
