          Teachable Machine Learning is the concept of empowering non-technical
          users to train, test, and deploy machine learning models without
          requiring expertise in programming or data science.

        <h2>Project Overview/Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          Our objective for this project is to create and train a machine to
          recognize our own objects through camera. As well as do a project
          statement reflecting on Buolawimini's book.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          We started by trying to train a machine learning model to recognize
          different writing utensils like pens, pencils, and highlighters. This
          didn’t work out well because the utensils were too small and thin,
          making it hard for the model to identify them correctly. So, we
          switched to larger and thicker objects, like pencil cases and
          scissors, which worked better. To help the model learn, we took a lot
          of pictures of each object from different angles and distances to
          create a variety of examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          During testing, the algorithm demonstrated reasonable accuracy but
          struggled with certain objects like the pencil case and eraser when
          they were positioned farther away. This was likely due to having fewer
          images of these objects compared to scissors. Additionally, we noticed
          that the model's performance could be limited by the lack of variety
          in our dataset, as we only had one of each object and didn’t capture
          photos in different lighting conditions. Overall, the process revealed
          that the quantity and diversity of training data significantly impact
          the algorithm’s ability to generalize and accurately identify objects.

        <h2>Project Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a subset of AI and one of the leading techniques
          that enable computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions
          without being explicitly programmed to. Through analysis and examples,
          machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, make predictions,
          and improve performance over time as they process more data. After
          learning about machine learning, this project gave us an opportunity
          to work hands-on at the many challenges Buolamwini describes in her
          book, Unmasking AI: my mission to protect what is human in a world of
          machines. Our project aimed at developing an object recognition
          algorithm using Teachable Machines to classify common school supplies
          such as pencil cases, scissors, and erasers. While we decided on
          classifying something more straightforward such as school supplies, we
          learned that there were still many decisions that go into making AI
          systems accurate and reliable. The process of creating and testing
          this algorithm provided valuable insights into both the technical
          challenges and broader ethical issues surrounding artificial
          intelligence, which are topics that are covered and explored through
          various real-life scenarios in Unmasking AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest takeaways from our project was realizing just how
          much the quality and variety of training data affect how well an AI
          system works. Since our dataset only included one example of each
          object, such as a single pencil case or a pair of scissors, the
          algorithm struggled to recognize anything even slightly different. We
          learned that it was quite particular with the environmental factors at
          play. Due to this, if we tested it with a pencil case of a different
          color or scissors with a different design, there’s a possibility that
          it would fail due to its lack of material variation. Joy Buolamwini
          talks about this in Unmasking AI, explaining how AI systems that are
          trained on narrow or unrepresentative data often perform poorly when
          applied in real-world situations, especially when dealing with diverse
          human populations. Even though our project was focused on objects, the
          same pattern showed up—if the training data isn’t diverse, the
          system’s abilities are going to be limited, no matter what it’s trying
          to identify. This correlation was one that nearly went unnoticed until
          it came to regrouping and reflecting on our thoughts and experiences
          and how they related to the material we have been learning about in
          this class.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          During our brainstorming process, we had initially planned on using
          writing utensils, such as pens, pencils, and highlighters as objects
          to test the algorithm. However, these objects needed to be bigger for
          the algorithm to effectively recognize them. So we had to change our
          plan, and switch to larger, thicker objects like pencil cases and
          scissors that would be easier to identify. While this change improved
          results, it also highlighted some limitations in our dataset. This
          little hiccup and the decision to lean in a different direction helped
          us recognize the importance of human decision-making in shaping the
          algorithm’s dataset and outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge we faced was the lack of variety in the objects we
          used. We only had one pencil case, one pair of scissors, and one
          eraser. So because of the limited variety, it made it difficult to
          ensure the algorithm’s accuracy. To train the algorithm, we took many
          pictures of each object from various angles and distances. This step
          proved essential in improving recognition accuracy. The algorithm,
          however, struggled when objects were too far from the camera. This was
          likely due to the fact that these objects had fewer training images
          compared to the others. Lastly, another limitation was the lighting
          conditions during training. Since we only took photos in a
          single-lighting setup, the algorithm might not have performed as well
          under different lighting. Through these processes, we learned that the
          more photos we provided for each object, the more accurate the
          algorithm was going to be. As well as the value of adaptivity, where
          we had to adapt and use different kinds of objects from the original
          planned objects when we ran into issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this project taught us a lot about the challenges and
          complexity of training an object recognition algorithm. Starting with
          our change of plans from our original classification to adapting and
          widening our scopes to include larger items. While this change
          improved accuracy, it highlights the importance of having a more
          varied dataset, because the algorithm may still struggle to recognize
          different sizes or types of the same object. We plan to include more
          object types, take photos in different settings, and test the
          algorithm in various scenarios to improve its accuracy and
          reliability. All of this to say, our decision to make these changes
          underscored a larger point: AI systems are only as robust as the data
          and design choices made by their developers. By reflecting on these,
          we hope to carry forward a more thoughtful and ethical approach to AI
          development.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Our project prompted us to think about how these technical and ethical
          challenges scale up in real-world applications. While our algorithm’s
          limitations primarily affected its ability to classify school
          supplies, there are similar biases in larger systems that can have
          much more serious consequences. Buolamwini’s work highlights numerous
          cases where biased AI systems have perpetuated discrimination, from
          facial recognition tools that misidentify, or fail to identify, people
          of color to hiring algorithms that disadvantage women. For us, these
          examples emphasized the importance of addressing bias early in the
          development process, even in a seemingly simple project like ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with a deeper understanding of the technical challenges involved
          in this project and with building an AI system, we are able to move on
          with the ethical responsibilities that come with it and take
          responsibility for our work. This small-scale representation of
          datasets in machine learning and our exposure to class materials have
          allowed us to take a step back and evaluate all of the cogs that tick
          to work these systems into place. Fairness and bias are essential
          considerations when creating algorithms for computers as they’re meant
          to pick up on patterns and make predictions.
