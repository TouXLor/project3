        <h2>Project Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Machine Learning is a subset of AI and one of the leading techniques 
          that enable computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without 
          being explicitly programmed to. Through examples and thorough analysis, 
          machine learning can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve 
          performance over time as they continue to process more data. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning about machine learning, this project gave us a hands-on 
          opportunity to reflect on the many challenges that Buolamwini describes in her book, Unmaking AI. 
          We learned that there were many decisions that go into making AI systems accurate and reliable. 
          The process of creating and testing this algorithm provided valuable insights into 
          the technical challenges and broader ethical issues surrounding AI.

        <h2>Project Overview/Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          Our objective for this project is to use machine learning to recognize 
          and classify common classroom items such as pencil cases, scissors, and erasers. 
          As we went through the motions of training a machine to differentiate between 
          different objects, we faced challenges and were able to think critically about 
          how our experience in this process related to the various topics 
          discussed in Unmasking AI by Joy Buolamiwini.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
          Originally, we aimed to train this machine-learning model to recognize 
          different writing utensils such as pens, pencils, and highlighters. 
          This didn’t work out well because they were too small and thin, making it 
          difficult for the model to identify them correctly through the camera. 
          We pivoted by switching to larger and thicker items that were still in the same realm, 
          which worked out better as they were more easily recognizable. To help the model learn, 
          we took multiple pictures of these objects from different angles and distances for the 
          machine to build a better understanding of the shape of these objects.
        </p>
        <img
          src="trained_pictures.png"
          alt="Picture of training process"
          class="machineLearningPics"
        />
        <p>
          Objects such as the pencil case and eraser were often misidentified 
          when positioned further away from the camera, likely due to having 
          fewer images of these specific objects compared to the scissors. 
          Additionally, the model’s performance was limited by the lack of variety 
          in our dataset, as we only had one of each object and did not capture 
          photos in different lighting conditions. For example, one of the failures 
          we encountered involved a pink eraser with two distinct sides: one blank 
          and the other with printed letters. When testing the AI with this eraser, 
          it incorrectly labeled the blank side as a pencil case but correctly 
          identified the side with letters as an eraser. This inconsistency highlighted
          the model’s reliance on specific visual features and its difficulty generalizing
          from limited data. Overall, the process revealed that the quantity and 
          diversity of training data significantly impact the algorithm’s ability 
          to generalize and accurately identify objects.

        <h2>Project Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning is a subset of AI and one of the leading techniques
          that enable computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions
          without being explicitly programmed to. Through analysis and examples,
          machine learning algorithms can identify patterns, make predictions,
          and improve performance over time as they process more data. After
          learning about machine learning, this project gave us an opportunity
          to work hands-on at the many challenges Buolamwini describes in her
          book, Unmasking AI: my mission to protect what is human in a world of
          machines. Our project aimed at developing an object recognition
          algorithm using Teachable Machines to classify common school supplies
          such as pencil cases, scissors, and erasers. While we decided on
          classifying something more straightforward such as school supplies, we
          learned that there were still many decisions that go into making AI
          systems accurate and reliable. The process of creating and testing
          this algorithm provided valuable insights into both the technical
          challenges and broader ethical issues surrounding artificial
          intelligence, which are topics that are covered and explored through
          various real-life scenarios in Unmasking AI.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Issues</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest takeaways from our project was realizing just how
          much the quality and variety of training data affect how well an AI
          system works. Since our dataset only included one example of each
          object, such as a single pencil case or a pair of scissors, the
          algorithm struggled to recognize anything even slightly different. We
          learned that it was quite particular with the environmental factors at
          play. Due to this, if we tested it with a pencil case of a different
          color or scissors with a different design, there’s a possibility that
          it would fail due to its lack of material variation. Joy Buolamwini
          talks about this in Unmasking AI, explaining how AI systems that are
          trained on narrow or unrepresentative data often perform poorly when
          applied in real-world situations, especially when dealing with diverse
          human populations. Even though our project was focused on objects, the
          same pattern showed up—if the training data isn’t diverse, the
          system’s abilities are going to be limited, no matter what it’s trying
          to identify. This correlation was one that nearly went unnoticed until
          it came to regrouping and reflecting on our thoughts and experiences
          and how they related to the material we have been learning about in
          this class.

        <h2>Our Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest takeaways from our project was realizing just how 
          much the quality and variety of training data affect how well an AI system works. 
          This process revealed that the quantity and diversity of training data 
          significantly impact the algorithm’s ability to generalize and accurately 
          identify objects. We learned that the machine was very particular with 
          the environmental factors at play, so due to our dataset and the conditions 
          of the lighting it’s probable that if we tested variations of the items 
          then there’s a possibility that it wouldn’t recognize it at all. Meaning 
          that a pencil case of a different color or a pair of scissors with a 
          different shape and design might not be properly categorized.

        <h2>Connections to the Book</h2>
        <p>
          Joy Buolamwini explains how AI systems that are trained on narrow or 
          unrepresentative data often perform poorly when applied in real-world situations, 
          especially when dealing with diverse human populations. Even though our project 
          was focused on objects, the same pattern showed up—if the training data isn’t diverse, 
          the system’s abilities are going to be limited, no matter what it’s trying to identify. 
          Our decision to make changes throughout the process of this model underscores 
          a larger point: AI systems are only as robust as the data and design choices 
          made by their developers. By reflecting on these, we hope to carry forward a more
          thoughtful and ethical approach to AI development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project prompted us to think about how these technical and ethical challenges 
          scale up in real-world applications. While our algorithm’s limitations primarily 
          affected its ability to classify school supplies, there are similar biases
          in larger systems that can have much more serious consequences. Buolamwini’s 
          work highlights numerous cases where biased AI systems have perpetuated 
          discrimination, from facial recognition tools that misidentify, or fail to
          identify, people of color to hiring algorithms that disadvantage women. 
          For us, these examples emphasized the importance of addressing bias 
          early in the development process, even in a seemingly simple project like ours.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          As we worked through the changes in this process, switching our 
          focus to different items, and making decisions that impacted 
          the performance of our model–it made us recognize the importance 
          of human decision-making in shaping an algorithm’s dataset and
          outcomes. Our image variety, positioning, and lighting setup
          were all factors that affected the accuracy of our model. 
          Through these processes, we learned that the more photos under
          different conditions we provided for each object, the more 
          accurate the machine was going to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with a deeper understanding of the technical 
          challenges involved in this project and with building
          an AI system, we are able to move on with the responsibilities 
          that come with it and take responsibility for our work. This 
          small-scale representation of datasets in machine learning and 
          our exposure to class materials have allowed us to take a step 
          back and evaluate all of the cogs that tick to work these systems 
          into place. Fairness and bias are essential considerations when 
          creating algorithms for computers as they’re meant to pick up on 
          patterns and make predictions.
