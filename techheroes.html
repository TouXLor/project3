        <h2>About Her</h2>
        <p>Timnit Gebru is an AI researcher and advocate known for her work on algorithmic bias, ethical AI, and the social implications of artificial intelligence. As a co-founder of the Black in AI community, she has been a vocal proponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech, highlighting the systemic barriers faced by Black researchers. Gebru gained widespread attention during her tenure at Google, where she co-led the Ethical AI team. Her departure in 2020, following her concerns about the ethical risks of large-scale language models and their potential to perpetuate bias, sparked a global conversation on ethics and inclusion in the tech industry. She continues to challenge norms by advocating for transparency, accountability, and social responsibility in AI development.
