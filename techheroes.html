        <h3>About Her</h3>
        <p>
          Timnit Gebru is an AI researcher and advocate known for her work on
          algorithmic bias, ethical AI, and the social implications of
          artificial intelligence. As a co-founder of the Black in AI community,
          she has been a vocal proponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in
          tech, highlighting the systemic barriers faced by Black researchers.
          Gebru gained widespread attention during her tenure at Google, where
          she co-led the Ethical AI team. Her departure in 2020, following her
          concerns about the ethical risks of large-scale language models and
          their potential to perpetuate bias, sparked a global conversation on
          ethics and inclusion in the tech industry. She continues to challenge
          norms by advocating for transparency, accountability, and social
          responsibility in AI development.

        <h3>About Her</h3>
        <p>
          Tamar Huggins, a Canadian tech entrepreneur, author, and educator,
          founded Tech Spark AI alongside her daughter, Talia Grant, eight years
          ago. Based in Toronto, Huggins has been a trailblazer in advancing
          diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech education, playing a key role
          in developing Canada's Black tech ecosystem. Her passion for
          technology and innovation has driven her to overcome challenges and
          create impactful change. Tech Spark AI is Canada's first tech and
          design school dedicated to empowering young girls and students of
          color through innovative tech programming. The school's mission is to
          help marginalized students see their culture positively reflected in
          their education. By providing culturally responsive curriculums,
          training for educators, and personalized AI tools, Tech Spark AI
          supports students in overcoming systemic barriers in STEM fields,
          preparing them to become creators and innovators within the tech
          industry. This approach aims to shift these communities from being
          mere consumers to creators of technology, promoting economic
          empowerment and reducing exclusion. Recently, Tech Spark AI launched
          "Spark Plug," a Black-owned alternative to ChatGPT. This tool allows
          users to translate class literature into modern languages, including
          African American Vernacular English (AAVE), further reflecting Tech
          Spark's commitment to inclusivity and cultural representation.
